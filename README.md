# Information about this repository:

Our presentation slides and executive summary is based on Navdeep Rana's results, which have the overall best error scores. 
Navdeep performed linear/polynomial regression model, knn model, random forest model and XGBoost model. 
The corresponding jupyter Notebooks are in the folder Notebooks/Work_by_Navedeep_Rana. 

Song Gao also made some attempts, which include linear regression, knn, random forest models with train-test split and 5 fold cross validation, and test the best model on the final test set.
The correponding notebook is Notebooks/Work_by_Song_Gao/Test_Model_SGao. 

The folder Data contains three csv files. 
The used_cars.csv file is the original data. 
The output.csv is the cleaned data.
The data_model.csv is created by Navdeep Rana including more feature engineering columns.

The folder EDA_and_Executive_Summary contains the EDA report and our executive summary.

The folder images contains supportive plots regarding our models.
